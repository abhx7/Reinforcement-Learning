# CS6700: Reinforcement Learning (IIT Madras, Jul–Nov 2025)

This repository is a student-curated supplement for the **CS6700: Reinforcement Learning** course taught by Prashanth L.A. at IIT Madras.

- **Past exam papers & model solutions** for practice  
- **Assignments**<!-- , complete with my own attempted solutions and code implementations  -->
- **Code examples and notebooks**<!--  , including implementations of dynamic programming, Q-learning, TD methods, policy gradients (REINFORCE, PPO), etc. -->
- **External resources**
