# CS6700: Reinforcement Learning (IIT Madras, Jul–Nov 2025)

This repository is a student-curated supplement for the **CS6700: Reinforcement Learning** course taught by Prashanth L.A. at IIT Madras.

## Why This Repo Exists

While the instructor's official site contains high-quality **lecture notes**, this repo is designed to enhance learning by providing:

- **Reference materials**: PDFs of key textbooks like *Bertsekas (Vol I & II)*, *Bertsekas & Tsitsiklis*, and *Sutton & Barto*  
- **Past exam papers & model solutions** for practice  
- **Assignments**<!-- , complete with my own attempted solutions and code implementations  -->
- **Code examples and notebooks**<!--  , including implementations of dynamic programming, Q-learning, TD methods, policy gradients (REINFORCE, PPO), etc. -->
- **External resources**

I also recommend checking out [mew-two-github’s Reinforcement Learning CS6700 Assignments repo](https://github.com/mew-two-github/Reinforcement-Learning-CS6700-Assignments/tree/master), which contains additional assignment solutions and resources.
